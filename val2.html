      <h1>Dear Ishika Merlyn,</h1>
      <div class="letter-body">
        <p><br><br>Time's been flowing so quick cause it's crazy to think it's been almost 5 months since we parted.
                    A constant occurrence in the past 5 months is you living rent free in my head(which I don't mind in the least).
                    The time I spent with you was truly something priceless.HAPPY VALENTINES DAY.
                      <br><br>
                    While it's unfortunate that valentines didn't happen when we were dating ,I really did enjoy celebrating 
                    every milestone with you.The thought of monthly anniversaries NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO ME.IT'S SO COOL and I've you to thank for that.
                    I really really really miss you,your thoughts,your laugh,your smile, your hair adn so much more.
                    Trust me when I say this being with you has made me a much better and more thoughtful person, you're probably like "no way this guy is fr",
                    I'm for real for real.Thank you for always helping me out when things were tough and letting me help you when it was difficult for you.
                    I wish you all the success and love and joy and MWAHHHHHH.
                      <br><br>
                    Just wanted to say how much you mean to me and that every memory of I have of you will be treasured.
                    Thank you so much for making my life brighter than ever.Lastly,I wish you all the best cutie, in everything
                    that you do.Gah you're so amazing and I can't stop thanking you for everything.I'll cherish every date we went on,every
                    movie we saw ,every restaurant we ate at and all teh letters and gifts you gave me.Take care.I love you Ishika.
